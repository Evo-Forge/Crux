        module: 'app'          # This is the angular's main module name.
        output: 'public/js/build/$module.angular.js' # This will be the file where all the angular.js functionality will be exported (except templates)

        output: 'public/js/build/$module.templates.js' # This will be the file containing the cached html view files.

server:

  render: 'swig'      # By default, the rendering system of choice is "swig" (http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/), chosen for its extensibility performance and stability.
  #url: null     # This setting is dynamically created based on the hostname/port/ssl configurations of the server. It will then be available under server.config.url, but it can also be overridden with a custom url.
  request:  # This part contains settings about a http request
    sesskey: 'demo.ssid'  # The session key we're going to use to store our settings.

  path: # Default paths to load.
    routes: 'app/routes'    # The back-end routing folder.
    views: 'app/views'      # The back-end views folder
    docs: 'app/docs'        # By default, the server will create documentation based on the defined routes
    public: 'public/'    # The default public folder. This will be accessible from the outside.
  views: # Default settings for the back-end viewing system.
    cache: false                # This should be set to true in production

  # express:   This is where we can specify other express-related configuration. See http://expressjs.com/3x/api.html

# Our example project will also use a mysql database. We use Sequelize ORM to wrap over mysql. This is where we set our settings.
sql:
  host: 'localhost' # This is the database's hostname.
  user: 'root'      # The database username & password.
  password: ''
  database: 'crux_example'  # The database we're using.
  debug: true       # This will log every query to the console. Can be disabled in production
  sync: false        # Whenever the application will start, this will try and sync all the model fields and create new tables. Should be set to false in production and manually diff the databases.
  setup: false      # CAUTION: this will REMOVE all tables from the database, and re-create the entire db. Should be used ONLY in development

    models: 'app/models'    # This is the folder where we're going to define our backend models.
    sql: 'app/models/sql'   # Our app may have custom SQL to execute after sync. Place sql files here.

# These settings are related to the main crux application, extended by our custom app.
# For example, we can define/create our own custom components and place them under app/components
